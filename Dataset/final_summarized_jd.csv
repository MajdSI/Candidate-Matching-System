Location city New York  
You started two thousand Efficio Specialist Management Consultancy focused on procurement supply chain improvement program.  
Currently Efficio has three hundred fifty employees globally with exciting plans to grow rapidly over the next eighteen months.  
A truly international organisation with thirty different languages spoken, the firm places high value on employees and offers great training and development opportunities to help career progression.  
Consultants return to the home office on Friday from client engagements to spend time with colleagues and attend training courses.  

Description:  
Given the growth, Efficio is going to be looking for Business Analysts to provide support to project teams working on consulting assignments.  
The Business Analyst role is targeted at graduate entry-level candidates as the first step into management consulting.  
Although based in the New York office, Business Analysts are at client sites four days a week and therefore need to be flexible with travel and working.  
Under the guidance of experienced consultants, a key role is to collect, analyse, and synthesise data from a variety of sources to gain insight and understanding.  
Analysis provides important input to the project team’s recommendations and solutions.  
Business Analysts also provide input to client presentations and work as team members in the day-to-day delivery of projects.  
For example, they may assist in developing and issuing Requests for Proposals, evaluating proposals from suppliers, and interacting with clients and suppliers as needed.  
Business Analysts are typically involved in client-facing projects from day one and need to be able to learn fast, get up to speed quickly, and work effectively under pressure.  
They must be able to work independently and also be team players willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of projects.  
The ability to prioritise work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential.  
Business Analysts are expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas; however, they are also expected to be able to justify conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous fact-based analysis.  

Efficio has a collaborative and supportive culture where performance is recognised and success celebrated.  
Business Analysts are supported to continually develop skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme, including formal training at the Efficio Academy, on-the-job training, coaching, and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives.  
Opportunities for support come with the role, making Efficio an unmatched springboard to a top-tier consulting career.

62,"Given growth, Efficio is going looking for a Business Analyst to provide support to the project team working on a consulting assignment. The Business Analyst role is targeted at graduate entry-level candidates as a first step into management consulting. Although based in the New York office, the Business Analyst will be at the client site four days a week and therefore needs to be flexible with travel. Working under the guidance of an experienced consultant, the key role is to collect, analyse, and synthesise data from a variety of sources to gain insight and understanding. Analysis will provide important input to the project team’s recommendations and solutions. The Business Analyst will also provide input to client presentations and work as a team member in the day-to-day delivery of the project. For example, they may assist in developing and issuing Requests for Proposals, evaluating supplier proposals, and interacting with clients and suppliers as needed. The Business Analyst is typically involved in client-facing projects from day one and needs to be able to learn fast, get up to speed quickly, and work effectively under pressure. They must be able to work independently, be a team player, and be willing to contribute wherever needed to ensure the success of the project. The ability to prioritise work effectively in the face of sometimes competing demands is also essential. The Business Analyst is expected to challenge existing ways of doing things and suggest new ideas; however, they are also expected to be able to justify conclusions and recommendations with relevant experience and rigorous fact-based analysis. Efficio has a collaborative and supportive culture where performance is recognised and success is celebrated. Business Analysts are supported to continually develop their skills and expertise through a comprehensive training and development programme, including formal training at the Efficio Academy, on-the-job training, and coaching and mentoring from experienced consultants and Efficio executives. The opportunity and support that come with the role make Efficio an unmatched springboard to a top-tier consulting career.

267,"AlphaSight searches five hundred million professionals working in the world today to find a small handful of experts qualified to answer client needs, using insight to drive amazing progress within an organisation. The mission is to provide access to dispersed, hidden, underutilized knowledge. We have made terrific progress working in a new space, but there is still an incredible amount of work; we have only scratched the surface of applying technology to the problem AlphaSight faces.  

Front End Engineer: build features across the ecosystem of products, both internal and client-facing. A Front End Engineer builds ambitious web applications at the edge of what is possible today in the browser. You will work closely with a variety of people in the business to arrive at the best solution, immediately see the impact of your work, and get feedback directly from users. You will be enabled to implement features across the entire stack, from client view to database layer.  

We are looking for people interested in building software systems to incredibly high standards, comfortable working across multiple languages, and able to learn quickly when new technology is introduced. You care about engineering skill versus deep knowledge of a particular language or framework. You will build front end architecture that pushes the boundaries of modern front end engineering, build fast ambitious web applications, and work closely with the product team and engineering team to build features with significant business impact. You will design elegant, intuitive user interface components and drive forward-thinking front end technology at AlphaSight.  

You will implement functionality necessary to power the front end and bring to life back end services. You will work in a small, nimble team, understand business context deeply, and leverage engineering knowledge to propose creative solutions to problems. You might fit if you have a deep understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, experience with Ember.js, and an understanding of the complexity of the Document Object Model and Cascading Style Sheets, especially in how they interact. You can interpret user interface performance metrics and address issues accordingly. You know and understand the implications of the latest developments in ECMAScript. You learn and mentor engineers, reason about trade-offs when discussing front end technology, and can navigate to write back end code.  

Besides JavaScript, you are also proficient in Java, Ruby, Python, or similar languages powering back end services. You are interested in working in a team applying data science to solve challenging business problems. You see yourself as an entrepreneur as well as an engineer, with at least five years of professional experience, having served as a technical lead for a specific application, product area, or level of infrastructure. You balance deep work with cross-team collaboration.  

Do not worry if your experience or background does not match exactly; we believe a broad spectrum of experience provides great perspective for solving problems in new, innovative ways. We would love to hear how you might work with us.  

You will build and schedule multi-party communication under heavy constraints, integrate software with browsers, web email clients, and web calendars to meet user needs, launch new product initiatives to delight clients, and differentiate our service. You will develop innovative search and discovery interfaces for mission-critical knowledge search in business.  

You would join a dynamic, multinational, diverse team that enjoys solving interesting problems in a collaborative environment. We welcome self-taught engineers as well as graduates from top computer science and engineering schools. Your coworkers will include motivated recent graduates as well as experienced industry leaders from companies such as Google and Amazon.","{
